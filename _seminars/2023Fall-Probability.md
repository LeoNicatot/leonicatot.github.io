title: Probability and Statistics (Fall 2023)

### Topic Introduction

*Probability* and *Statistics* are two closely-related but different topics. While both of them study the black box of randomness, they focus on different problems: 

- *Probability*: I have known the *inside mechanism*. What are the *outside behaviors*?
- *Statistical Inference*: I have known the *outside behaviors*. What is the *inside mechanism*?

*Probability* (including *Random Process*) is a very important **theoretical mathematical model** for many advanced topics, *e.g.*, *Advanced Algorithms* (including *Randomized Algorithms* and *Approximation Algorithms*), *Analysis of Algorithms*, *Combinatorial Mathematics* (particularly, *The Probabilistic Methods* popularized by [Paul Erdős[ˈɛrdøːʃ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s)), *etc*.

Based on *Probability*, *Statistics* is a very important **applied mathematical tool** to solve many problems. For example, it is the basis of most *Machine Learning* algorithms. Actually, since most Machine Learning algorithms come from the field of *Statistical Learning*, it is fair to say that a large part of *Machine Learning* belongs to *Statistics*. Besides, if you want to be a great **decision maker** (e.g., policy maker in government, investor, *etc.*), *Statistics* will be essential for you. In my view, *Statistics* is the core of *Data Science*.

### Seminar Information

#### Content

In this seminar, we'll be using *Probability and Computing* by *Michael Mitzenmacher* and *Eli Upfal* as our main material. Hopefully, we will cover at least **Chapter 1 to Chapter 7** of this book in this seminar, which are: 

- Events and Probability
- Discrete Random Variables and Expectation
- Moments and Deviations
- Chernoff and Hoeffding Bounds
- Balls, Bins, and Random Graphs
- The Probabilistic Methods
- Markov Chains and Random Walks

Besides, we might also cover some topics beyond these 7 chapters: 

- Probability Theory
  - Continuous Random Variable
  - Law of Large Number & Central Limit Theorem
  - Concentration of Measure
- Statistics
  - Parameter Estimation
  - Hypothesis Testing
- Some Randomized Algorithms
- Some Machine Learning Algorithms and Ideas
- ...

#### Schedule

The detailed schedule will be updated later.
