### Seminar Info

*Probability* (including *Random Process*) is a very important mathematical tool for many advanced topics, *e.g.*, *Advanced Algorithms*(including *Randomized Algorithms* and *Approximation Algorithms*), *Analysis of Algorithms*, *Combinatorial Mathematics* (particularly, *The Probabilistic Methods* popularized by [Paul Erdős(ˈɛrdøːʃ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s)), *Machine Learning*, *Statistics*, *etc*.

In order to dive into the core of Computer Science and do more interesting research, we decide to host a **Probability and Computing** Seminar in the fall semester of 2024 (2023/9 ~ 2024/1). We'll be using *Probability and Computing* by *Michael Mitzenmacher* and *Eli Upfal* as our main material. Hopefully, we will cover at least **Chapter 1 to Chapter 7** of this book in this seminar, which are: 

- Events and Probability
- Discrete Random Variables and Expectation
- Moments and Deviations
- Chernoff and Hoeffding Bounds
- Balls, Bins, and Random Graphs
- The Probabilistic Methods
- Markov Chains and Random Walks

Besides, we might cover some topics in frontier research (mostly not from TCS), such as the *generation of Covering Array for Combinatorial Testing*, *Zero-Knowledge Proof*, *etc*. 

The reason why we want to cover these is that learning theory is important though, **finding and solving the real problems** is important as well, which is often neglected. We believe our undergraduates are intelligent enough to solve tricky problems in frontier research — the only thing lacking is that they haven't had access to the real problems, or at least nobody tries to lead them to find the real and impactful problems.

We will hold this seminar once a week. Each time a speaker will give a talk/lecture on a certain topic with slides (and maybe notes). At that time, these slides and notes will be available on this page.

### Schedule

The detailed schedule will be updated later.
