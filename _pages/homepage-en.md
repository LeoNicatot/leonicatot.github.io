Leo Nicatot is currently a Computer Science graduate student in Nanjing University, China. ~~He is interested in almost everything except CS~~ (just a joke, he's interested in everything, **even** CS). His current advisor is [Professor Xintao Niu](https://niuxintao.github.io/).

Nicatot sucks at doing engineering, because he hasn't received enough positive feedback from doing engineering (just an excuse, the real reason is that he is a *lazy* guy). Therefore, his advisor suggests him do some theoretical works, which makes him feel frightened and helpless.

Currently, Nicatot is interested in many branches of computer science, but mainly focuses on **software testing**. He is also interested in theory like mathematics and algorithms, but he is too weak and too stupid to handle tricky problems in these areas. 

Besides computer science, Nicatot is an ominivorous guy. He is interested in so many things that (almost) everyone can find something to chat with him. Among fields he knows about, phonetics and psychology are probably the things he is most familiar with.

Nicatot loves working in a team. Working in a *comfortable*, *passionate*, *strongly-connected* team where *everyone trusts each other*, is what Nicatot prefers, rather than working on something with high salary but with pain and frustration. If you’re interested in organizing a team to aim for something interesting or important, you’re welcomed to find Nicatot to do it together.
