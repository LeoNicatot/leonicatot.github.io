Leo Nicatot is currently a Computer Science graduate student in Nanjing University, China. ~~He is interested in almost everything except CS~~ (just a joke, he's interested in everything, **even** CS). His current advisors are [Professor Changhai Nie](https://gist.nju.edu.cn/changhai/public_html/) and [Professor Xintao Niu](https://niuxintao.github.io/).

Nicatot sucks at doing engineering, because he hasn't received enough positive feedback from doing engineering (just an excuse, the real reason is that he is a *lazy* guy). Therefore, his advisor suggests him to do some theoretical works, which makes him feel frightened and helpless.
