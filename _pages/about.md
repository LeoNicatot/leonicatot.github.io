Leo Nicatot is currently a Computer Science graduate student in Nanjing University, China. ~~He is interested in almost everything except CS~~ (just a joke, he's interested in everything, **even** CS). His current advisors are [Professor Changhai Nie](https://gist.nju.edu.cn/changhai/public_html/) and [Professor Xintao Niu](https://niuxintao.github.io/).

Nicatot sucks at doing engineering, because he hasn't received enough positive feedback from doing engineering (just an excuse, the real reason is that he is a *lazy* guy). Therefore, his advisor suggests him to do some theoretical works, which makes him feel frightened and helpless.

From Sept. 2023, [Professor Xintao Niu](https://niuxintao.github.io/) is going to host a *discussion seminar* on **Probability and Computing** for undergraduates in our group (Students who are not our members should get permission from Professor Niu to attend this seminar), in Suzhou Campus, Nanjing University. All the resources (slides, notes, *etc.*) will be released on this site then.
