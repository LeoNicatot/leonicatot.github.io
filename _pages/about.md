Leo Nicatot is currently a Computer Science graduate student in Nanjing University, China. ~~He is interested in almost everything except CS~~ (just a joke, he's interested in everything, **even** CS). His current advisors are [Professor Changhai Nie](https://gist.nju.edu.cn/changhai/public_html/) and [Professor Xintao Niu](https://niuxintao.github.io/).

Nicatot sucks at doing engineering, because he hasn't received enough positive feedback from doing engineering (just an excuse, the real reason is that he is a *lazy* guy). Therefore, his advisor suggests him to do some theoretical works, which makes him feel frightened and helpless.

Currently, Nicatot is interested in many branches of computer science, but mainly focuses on Software Engineering and Programming Languages. Besides computer science, he is also interested in phonetics and psychology. Since he is curious about many things, you can talk about your interests with him.

Nicatot loves working in a team. If you’re interested in organizing a team to do some interesting things, you’re welcomed to find Nicatot to do it together.
