#### From Others

1. Everything is a state machine. — from [jyy](https://jyywiki.cn)
2. The only difference between a FA and a TM is that the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil. — from [Manuel Blum](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/grad.html)

#### Mine

1. 是否Bottom-up取决于what we have，是否top-down取决于what we want
2. Si和Ni都记录了过去的经历。不同的是，Si保留了原汁原味的体验，Ni则是把这些体验全部搅碎后重组
