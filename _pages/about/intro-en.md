This page will introduce more about me. I’ll talk about me in various aspects, which covers my interests, my experiences, and what I’m planning to do.

## Computer Science

When I finished the College Entrance Examination (aka 高考), I don’t know which major to choose. Some people suggest me to choose Computer Science as my major. Their justification is “*Since you don’t know what you like, it would be the best to choose a major that can make sure you can earn a living without too much pressure*”. I have to say that this is a fabulous reason.

After the first year in University, I found CS really interesting. It has a lot of elegant theories, it is powerful to create something. I regarded CS as a perfect mix of Science and Engineering. At this time, I thought I’m so lucky to choose CS as my major!

But later, my thoughts changed. After witnessing many unjust things and heartbreaking scenes, I thought technology isn’t helpful for our society and the world to get peace and harmony. I lost interest in studying CS, and I was considering switching my major to some humanity majors.

My thoughts changed again after I approached some people who majored in humanity. Surprisingly, I found most of them are also incapable of dealing with these problems. They do not have the power to influence the world as well. After that, I continue to studying CS, but I’m also keeping in touch with these humanity fields. I believe that I’ll benefit from these knowledge. But before doing something influential, I need to establish my career first — only in this way can I have the muscle to influence.

When my third years ended, I needed to decide where should I go. At first, I had no interest in doing research. I thought most research are useless and boring. It was more appealing to go to work, because programmers can get a rather high salary then. However, I thought maybe I should go to a better university to see what those top researchers are doing. 

Luckily, I met Professor Niu at NJU, who enlightened me that doing research can be a lot of fun. Professor Niu is very passionate about novel ideas, and he has a lot of deep thoughts. Therefore, I decide to do research with him. Currently, I’m laying foundation for Software Engineering and Programming Languages. Meanwhile, we’re hosting discussion seminars in Suzhou Campus, which aims to build a community of studying advanced topics. 

## Phonetics

At a young age, I was interested in imitating the sounds of languages. I tried to learn some foreign languages like French, German, Thai, *etc.* During the process, I found it difficult to learn the new sounds in a new language. Maybe that’s why I find phonetics interesting because phonetics can help me learn these new sounds more easily by knowing how they are made.

In 2020, I met T. Y. Wang<d-footnote>T. Y. Wang majored in chemistry while at SYSU, but now he is a graduate learning Composition at CCOM(Central Conservatory of Music). You can find him at <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/wx3d61f0b2908f92a5">知乎</a> and <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/395133818">Bilibili</a></d-footnote> at SYSU, who introduced me to the [IPA(International Phonetic Alphabet)](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/IPA_chart_orig/pdfs/IPA_Kiel_2020_full.pdf). He is also interested in languages — he is good at Middle Chinese (中古汉语) and phonetics, and he has also learned Latin and a bunch of European languages. In the winter vacation of 2021, we learned Cantonese together with the help of B. Y. Xu, who is my roommate and a Guangzhou native.

Though I have some practical experience, I don’t have rigorous theoretical knowledge of phonetics. Therefore, I’m trying to read some textbooks on phonetics, like *A Course in Phonetics* by Peter Ladefoged and Keith Johnson, or *Phonetics* by *Xiaonong Zhu* (朱晓农). 

Besides phonetics, however, I’m not that interested in other aspects of linguistics. I think it is because I’m not interested in history and culture. In my view, language is no more than a carrier of thoughts or a tool for communicating. I care more about the thoughts carried by language, but not the carrier itself.

## Psychology

The older I get, the more I realize that self-knowledge is important. With the aid of psychology, I successfully enrich my knowledge of myself. Many people think they know themselves. But when it comes to making decisions, they manifests great hesitations.

Self-knowledge includes many aspects, *e.g.*, What personality I have? What do I like and dislike? Do these personality shaped by environment or culture? Do they conflict with my instinct/genes? If yes, how to reconcile them? I’m not dare to say that I know myself really well, but at least I’m getting better at it from time to time.

After knowing myself (*i.e.* I know who am I, what I want, *etc.*), I need to interact with the environment to have a better life. At this time, knowing others is important. 

The books I’ve read so far are mostly for crowds. Therefore, they’re not that rigorous and theoretic. I’m planning to read some textbooks on psychology, *e.g.*, *theories of personality* by Schultz couple.

### Relationships

The first chapter of *Intimate Relationships* by *Rowland S. Miller* taught me that sociality and intimate relationships are necessary for a human being, which is determined by our genes. Therefore, building and maintaining healthy relationships constitutes an important topic of my life.

## Chorus

In 2018, I joined the Chorus of SYSU (East Campus) led by Li Zheng<d-footnote>We all call him 冷爷. He is now the associated director and chief bass of Shanghai Rainbow Chamber Singers. He is a fabulous and passionate conductor.</d-footnote>. In this chorus, I was initiated to chorus and vocal music. Before that, I had learned some violin, so I had been equipped with some basic music theory and musicality. 

I spent one and a half years in this chorus. I met a lot of friends here, I experienced a lot here, and I learned a lot here. This experience made me realize that I enjoy working in a group rather than independently. The interaction, the cooperation, …, these are all amazing things that enrich my life. Therefore, I’m looking for communities, groups, or teams from time to time. And that’s why I love studying seminars — learning with a group can better motivate me and bring me more joy.
